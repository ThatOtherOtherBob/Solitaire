# Solitaire v1.0.0

By LBob / TooB

Move the cursor with the d-pad.

Select (or flip) cards with A.

Once a card is selected, clicking A on the same space unselects.

Pressing A at a different place attempts to move the card there.

Cancel with B.

X flips over cards on the bottom row that need flipping.

Y resets the cursor to the top-left position.

Reset with MENU.  (The start-ish button)

HOME brings up the system menu, letting you quit.  (The select-ish button)

This could certainly be better.
A menu to let you re-assign keys.
A button option to let you send the selected card to the ace-area.
Moving the "set-top-left" button to select a different position.
Different fonts / colors, changing the fonts to be pre-rendered text in the bitmap.  (Plenty of room...)
Replacing the text functions with.
The card backs could be better.
The card fronts could be better.
Increasing the card dimensions from 30x50 would help.
Low-res mode for those with older eyes.
An option to turn off the vibrate on error to make the game a little more silent.  (There's no helping all the clicking.)
In-game help.
Scoring.
An option to draw three cards at once instead of one.  (For now, if you want to play like that, click the draw-deck three times instead of once.)
Score-keeping.
A field that collapses as you get rid of lower columns so there's less to d-pad through.
Changing the color of a selected card instead of using the current 2-arrow system.
Victory credits?
